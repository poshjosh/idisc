            According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.abujafacts.ng/">abujafacts.ng</a>, 
            Kajuru Castle was built in 1978 by a controversial German expatriate
            who lived in Kaduna at the time. This breathtaking architectural 
            master-piece is a tourist wonder of sorts. The style is very European 
            and clearly German with a baronial hall, complete with suits of armour.

            and replace it with a visit to Kajuru Castle. You won't regret it!
